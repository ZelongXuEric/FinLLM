To stay within the safest bounds of corporate law, issuing so many shares as compensation would require an independent board committee's sign-off and a vote of disinterested shareholders.\"},{\"type\":\"social_media\",\"sub_type\":\"twitter\",\"html\":\"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having ~25% voting control.", "has_causal_keyword": false, "TSLA_open": 209.9900055, "TSLA_high": 213.1900024, "TSLA_low": 207.5599976, "TSLA_close": 212.1900024, "TSLA_adj_close": 212.1900024, "TSLA_volume": 102095800, "TSLA_ret_pct_D0": 0.146308076, "TSLA_cat_D0": "Flat", "TSLA_ret_pct_D+1": -1.597624464, "TSLA_cat_D+1": "Small Down", "TSLA_ret_pct_D+2": -1.437392439, "TSLA_cat_D+2": "Small Down", "causal_label": "Yes", "assoc_label": "Yes"}
